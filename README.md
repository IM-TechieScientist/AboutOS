# AboutOS
This is an "about OS" application that is inspired by Mac OS's About this Mac feature..but for linux(debian)
THis works on ARM(Raspberry Pi) and on x86 linux as long as it's debian based(raspberry pi os, ubuntu etc)
It is coded on python and uses Gtk so incredibly light-weight and fast on low resource Computers..
